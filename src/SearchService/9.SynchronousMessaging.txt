For our first approach we put the
auctions.json data directly in our data folder

but we now get that data from between MicroServices

1. Add a new Folder call Services

2. Inside of the Services folder add a AuctionSvcHttpClient.cs file

3. add the url in the appsetting.development.json

{
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Information",
      "Microsoft.AspNetCore": "Information"
    }
  },
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "MongoDbConnection": "mongodb://root:mongopw@localhost"
  },
  "AuctionServiceUrl" : "http://localhost:7001"
}

4. Inside the program.cs file add the service

builder.Services.AddHttpClient<AuctionSvcHttpClient>();

5. Change the DbInitializer to get the data from the httpClient Instead

6. reset the docker for MongoDB Service
By Deleting It

then recompose it
by command 

docker compose up -d

or delete the  volume by using the command

docker volume list
docker volume rm <volume name>
