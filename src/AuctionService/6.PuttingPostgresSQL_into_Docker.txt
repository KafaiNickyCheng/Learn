Now we got our PostgresSQL then we now need to put our database
into the Docker Container

So we need to create a DockerCompose file in order to tell
what it is need to be running on docker

0.1 install the docker extentions

1. In the root directory (outside of the src folder)
Create a new file name call
docker-compose.yml

2. write the instruction code

services: # provides the service
  postgres: # given a database name
    image: postgres
    environment: # set up the environment
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgrespw # password of the database
    ports: # tell docker of which port the server is running
      - 5432:5432
    volumes: # tell docker to use external storage
      - pgdata:/var/lib/postresql/data
volumes:
  pgdata:


3. run the docker by (make sure to move out of the src folder)
docker compose up -d 

4. take a look in the docker desktop app
then go to the container tab and you should see docker is running

5.  go back to src/AuctionService folder
cd src/AuctionService

then run the command
dotnet ef database update

(this will add our table to our docker backend server)

6. go to extentions
install PostgresSQL

7. in the vscode go to the Postgres Tab
then add connection (a + sign)
hostname --> localhost
user --> postgres
password --> postgrespw
port --> 5432
ssl connection --> Standard connection
database name --> Auction
displayname of database --> localhost
