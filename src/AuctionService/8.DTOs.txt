Data Transfer Object

This will Shape our data (like mapping)

So a Dto should be like split into different shape of data

The Standard Shape (AuctionDto)

The Shape when the user is gonna insert the value (CreateAuctionDto)
 
and The Shape when the user is gonna updated the value (UpdateAuctionDto)


Once Created these 3 Dtos then add a new folder
inside of the src/AuctionService

called RequestHelpers

and inside of our RequestHelper is where we put our auto mapper inside
(See Comments in code)

And Inside the program.cs you need to add

builder.Services.AddAutoMapper(AppDomain.CurrentDomain.GetAssemblies());
