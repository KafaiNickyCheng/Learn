Let say you have two Service and need to communicate


Service A  ----------- Request -------------> Service B
           <----------- Response ------------

So Service A need to know the address of the Service B

we can use Http or gRPC to communicate

Http is synchronus messaging

but the code we write in the microservice async

but even that the client still need to wait the Response

And This is not good beacuse if Service A need data from Service B
then Service B need to start first
Otherwise if Service A start first then it cannot fetch the data and it will failed

Or Otherwise Service A need to keep calling and calling Service B in loop until it get running
